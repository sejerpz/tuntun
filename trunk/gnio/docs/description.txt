New classes added to GIO (marked by *):

GObject
 |- GInetAddress *
 |   |- GInet4Address *
 |   \- GInet6Address *
 |
 |- GSocketAddress *
 |   \- GInetSocketAddress *
 |
 |- GNetworkInputStream * (implements GInputStream)
 |- GNetworkOutputStream * (implements GOutputStream)
 |
 |- GSocket *
 |
 |- GSocketConnection *
 |   \- GTCPConnection *
 |
 \- GSocketServer *
     \- GTCPServer *

I've also written another library (in Vala), which I'm currently calling "gurl", with the following:

GObject
 |- GurlURI * (mostly copied from GVfsDecodedUri, utility for URI handling)
 |
 |- GurlOpener * (handles opening URIs)
 |
 \- GurlBaseHandler * (base handler for requests)
     |- GurlBaseHttpHandler *
     |- GurlHttpHandler *
     |- GurlHttpBasicAuthHandler *
     |- GurlHttp

This design is based roughly off of Python's urllib2. It is intended mostly as a libsoup replacement built on g(n)io, as well as being a good test for the gnio stuff. The 
handlers are loaded using gio extension points, so that gurl doesn't have to link to gnutls or openssl but can load them if available in lib/gio/modules.

I have an initial patch that makes SoupAddress just a thin wrapper around GSocketAddress, but "porting" anything else in Soup to use gnio would be hard without breaking ABI 
(since Soup lets you pick a GMainContext, something that was omitted in gio [1]), at which point SoupSocket/Address would disappear anyways [2].
