=== Preface ===

_*Tuntun*_ is a GNOME applet written in Vala useful to manage Vpn connections. It's a GUI that can show the state of a VPN connection and open or close it through the *OpenVpn Management Interface*.

=== Usage ===

After adding it to the GNOME panel, you can configure the predefined Open VPN connections by clicking with the right mouse button on the Tuntun icon and then selecting the item Properties from the popup menu:

You can add, remove a connection with the buttons _add, remove_ or modify its properties in a window like the following with the button _properties:_

  * Name: connection's name
  * Address: ip address or server name where OpenVPN is running (usually localhost)
  * Port: port number where the server is listening, written in the connection config option '_management_'.

You can simply open or close a connection by selecting it on the menu that will popup with a left clck on the Tuntun icon. A boubble window will appear whenever the connection state change.
